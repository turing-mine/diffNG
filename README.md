# diffNG
diffNG (differential engine) is a simple Express server for static React, Angular and Vue build deployments.

It can be added to any Node project as a production or dev GitHub dependency.

Both deployment agnostic and an NPM Module dependency fractal, diffNG can be used as-is for a cloud function, as a content server for React/Angualr/Vue dev work, and as an NPM module dependency for Docker-containerized apps.

Oh, the fractal part means that because it's a dependency, it can provide metaphorical data in testing the same way it does as a dev or production dependency.

It is not made to route or pass oAuth credentials securely.  Rather, it's made simply, for ease of deployment as a Docker container.
