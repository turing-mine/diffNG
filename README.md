# diffNG
diffNG (differential engine) is a simple Express server for static Angular, React and Vue build deployments.

It can be added to any Node project as a production or dev GitHub dependency.

Both deployment agnostic and an NPM Module dependency fractal, diffNG can be used as-is for a cloud function, as a content server for Angular/React/Vue dev work, and as an NPM module dependency for Docker-containerized apps.
